## Important points while making any changes !!!!!!Read these before making any changes!!!!!!
1. Please make everything component based. Create components and reuse them do not add thousands of lines of code in single file it's very difficult to track.
2. If you are working on any page let's say login page then add it's code in `src/component/login` folder do not add it in direct `src`.
3. If you adding, writing any code, media files add them all in src folder only in `src`.
4. If you are adding any components add them in `src/component`.
5. If you are adding any media files such as gif, images, icons add them in `src/assets` folder.
6. Create new branches for every feature you are adding. If you dare to make any changes directly to `master` branch I'll barge into you house and whoop your a**.
7. Name files and components in such a way that it would be easier for others to understand. Don't make others life difficult it's already difficult to survive outside. You can name inner variables seema, tina blah, blah. Nobodys gonna care just write in comment what that component is used for and if there is any data connection mention in it where are you supposed to add that.
